The first test will be on unit driver 0 to see if it actually stored the memory. Coalescing is off and the first fit policy is used for the first few tests. We will just do the simple test without equilibrium testing.

The second test will be on unit driver 1 to see if it can manage multiple items on a list.

The third test will be on a new unit driver 2 which will allocate 3 blocks and then free the middle one.

The fourth test will be on unit driver 3 that will have 2 1/4 blocks first and then 4 1/8 blocks after.
