The first test will be on unit driver 0 to see if it actually stored the memory. Coalescing is off and the first fit policy is used for the first few tests. We will just do the simple test without equilibrium testing.

The second test will be on unit driver 1 to see if it can manage multiple items on a list.

The third test will be on a new unit driver 2 which will allocate 3 blocks and then free the middle one.

The fourth test will be on unit driver 3 that will have 2 3/8 blocks first and 2 1/8 blocks after. We will then free the first 3/8 block and the first 1/8 block. Then we will allocate 1/8 to where the first 3/8 block used to be. This is on both first-fit and best-fit.

The fifth test is a repeat of the fourth test with coalescing activated.

The sixth test is to test the performance of the program in the 4 possible cases which are first-fit without coalescing, best-fit without coalescing, first-fit with coalescing, and best-fit without coalescing.
